# Roadmap

The backlog for the nightly loop. Tasks are ordered by priority — take the
highest unchecked one that fits in a single pull request.

Each task lists acceptance criteria. A task is done when those hold, tests cover
them, and `make check` passes. Tick the box in the same PR that implements it.

If a task turns out to be larger than one PR, land the smallest useful slice,
tick nothing, and split the remainder into new tasks here.

## Milestone 1 — Live cluster data

The tool currently reads kubeconfig only. This milestone makes it talk to a
cluster.

- [ ] **Async runtime and Kubernetes client bootstrap.**
  Add `tokio`, `kube`, and `k8s-openapi`. Build a client from the selected
  context. Add `eks nodes` printing name, status, version, age.
  *Acceptance:* works against a real EKS cluster; a missing/expired credential
  produces a clear message naming the context and suggesting
  `aws sso login`, not a raw HTTP error; node-row formatting is a pure function
  tested against fixture `Node` objects; no live-AWS test.

- [ ] **Node capacity and allocatable.**
  Show CPU and memory capacity, allocatable, and the sum of pod requests per
  node, with utilisation percentages.
  *Acceptance:* Kubernetes quantity parsing (`100m`, `1.5`, `2Gi`, `1e3`) is its
  own tested function covering each suffix and rejecting garbage; percentages
  use `theme::Severity` thresholds.

- [ ] **`eks pods` listing.**
  Pods for a namespace (or `--all-namespaces`) with status, ready count,
  restarts, age, and node.
  *Acceptance:* phase derivation matches `kubectl` for the awkward cases —
  `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Terminating`, `Init:0/2`, `Completed`; each has a test.

- [ ] **metrics-server integration.**
  Live CPU/memory usage for nodes and pods where `metrics.k8s.io` is available.
  *Acceptance:* absent metrics-server degrades to showing requests with a note,
  never an error; the API call is behind a trait so it can be faked in tests.

## Milestone 2 — The dashboard

- [ ] **Node pane with live data.**
  Replace the placeholder overview with a node list: utilisation bars, pod
  counts, conditions.
  *Acceptance:* first paint happens before data arrives; loading state is
  visible; `TestBackend` tests for loading, loaded, and error states.

- [ ] **Background refresh.**
  Move fetching onto a background task feeding the UI over a channel. Refresh on
  an interval and on demand (`r`).
  *Acceptance:* the render loop never awaits a network call; a hung API call
  leaves the UI fully navigable; refresh interval is configurable.

- [ ] **Pod browsing.**
  Drill from a node into its pods, and from a pod into its containers. Namespace
  filter. Breadcrumbs showing where you are.
  *Acceptance:* every view is reachable and escapable by keyboard alone;
  navigation state transitions are unit-tested without a terminal.

- [ ] **Pod detail view.**
  Containers, images, resource requests/limits, restart reasons, recent events.
  *Acceptance:* long values wrap rather than truncate; tested at 80 columns.

- [ ] **Log viewing.**
  Stream logs for a container, with follow, scrollback, and wrap toggle.
  *Acceptance:* streaming never blocks input; leaving the view cancels the
  request; a 10k-line burst does not stall the UI.

- [ ] **Fuzzy search.**
  `/` filters the current view. Fuzzy, case-insensitive, ranked.
  *Acceptance:* the matcher is a pure, tested function; filtering 10k rows stays
  under one frame — cover it with a benchmark.

## Milestone 3 — Polish

- [ ] **Config file.**
  `~/.config/eks/config.toml` for theme, refresh interval, default namespace.
  CLI flags override the file; the file overrides defaults.
  *Acceptance:* precedence is tested; a malformed file warns and falls back to
  defaults rather than exiting.

- [ ] **Light theme and auto-detection.**
  Detect terminal background where possible, with a config override.
  *Acceptance:* both themes meet WCAG AA contrast for body text; a test asserts
  the contrast ratios.

- [ ] **Startup budget and benchmarks.**
  Add `criterion` benchmarks for kubeconfig parsing and first paint. Document
  the budget from CLAUDE.md and measure against it.
  *Acceptance:* `make bench` runs; CI reports regressions rather than failing.

- [ ] **Shell completions and a man page.**
  Generate from the clap definition via `clap_complete` and `clap_mangen`.
  *Acceptance:* `eks completions bash|zsh|fish` emits valid output; generation
  is covered by a test; `make dist` includes them.

- [ ] **Golden-file rendering tests.**
  Use `insta` snapshots over `TestBackend` for the main views.
  *Acceptance:* snapshots committed; `cargo insta` workflow documented in
  CONTRIBUTING-level detail in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Milestone 4 — Distribution and hardening

- [ ] **More release targets.**
  Add `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` to the release
  workflow.
  *Acceptance:* both cross-compile in CI; musl binary is verified static.

- [ ] **Supply-chain checks in CI.**
  `cargo-deny` for advisories, licences, and duplicate versions.
  *Acceptance:* runs on PRs; `deny.toml` committed with rationale for any
  allowance.

- [ ] **MSRV verification job.**
  Build against the `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` so it stops being a claim.
  *Acceptance:* CI job pinned to that toolchain.

- [ ] **Install story.**
  An install script and a Homebrew tap formula.
  *Acceptance:* `README.md` documents install for macOS and Linux; the script
  verifies checksums.

## Done

Nothing yet — this section records completed milestones as the loop ticks along.

## Ideas, not yet scheduled

Pull these up into a milestone when they become the most valuable next thing.

- Multi-account support (the current design assumes one AWS account).
- `eks exec` into a container, and port-forwarding.
- Resource editing — scale a deployment, delete a pod, cordon/drain a node.
  Needs a confirmation-and-undo design first; destructive actions deserve care.
- Cost attribution per namespace or workload.
- CloudWatch and control-plane log integration.
- Watch-based incremental updates instead of polling.
- A `--json` output mode across every read command for scripting.
